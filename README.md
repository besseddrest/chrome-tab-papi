# Tab Papi

Your girlfriend's favorite tab manager.

## General

Tab Papi will help you manage your excessive tab abuse. If you are a keyboard
focused computer user, you might like this. It's more about needing to close
a bunch of tabs, rather than carefully grooming them.

I made this for fun. I hope you find this useful!

## Permissions / Disclaimer

You will need to grant Papi permission. It relies on the tab's URL in order for
it to organize all the tab data for display. That data is fetched when you first open the
extension, and it's saved in your local storage. It will update its local
storage any time you make changes to the window's tabs.

The initial fetch will return info on all tabs for all open Google Chrome
windows, which includes pages installed as apps. This is just a minor detail.
Opening the Tab Papi extension will only display the tab in formation for that
specific window.

## Keybinds / TLDR;

Note: I use Linux so these bindings are based on `Ctrl`.

## Detailed Usage

Install Tab Papi, enable it & grant it permission, and pin it.

`Ctrl + P` (for Papi) will open the Tab Papi popup.

The tabs for the current window will be grouped by hostname, and sorted by total number of tabs in that group, descending order.

`Tab` will allow you to cycle btwn the tabbed content. At the moment
this is just between the main & info sections.

You can move up and down your tab list with arrows or j & k. Actions will only
affect the selected row. Navigation and actions only work when you are on the
main tab.

<!-- 1-4 will reduce the number of tabs in the selected row to that number of tabs. -->
