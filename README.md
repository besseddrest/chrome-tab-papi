# Tab Papi

Your girlfriend's favorite tab manager.

## Purpose

Manage your tab clutter with speed, from your keyboard.

If you use vim, you might like this.

## Permissions

You will need to grant Papi permission. It uses the tab URLs in order to sort the data, and then manages that list from local storage.

It fetches the tab data for the current window everytime you open Tab Papi.

## Keybinds

**The keybinds only work with Tab Papi open, and will only work on your current window.**
TBA

## Detailed Usage

* Moving up & down highlights the row - this is the 'selected' group of tabs
* The actions only apply to the selected tabs
* Hitting `Tab` will toggle btwn the Current / Info tabs

Will be adding additional features. Enjoy.
