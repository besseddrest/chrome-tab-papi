# Tab Papi

Your girlfriend's favorite tab manager.

## General

You know you have a problem. 30+ tabs in one window? Multiple windows?!

You can easily just close those them - but you don't. You think there's something important on one of those tabs. You definitely can't remember what that is, but you're stubborn.

I made this so I can reduce my tab clutter quickly from my keyboard.

You'll feel semi-accomplished. It's like... doing your laundry but being to lazy to fold it and put it away.

## Permissions / Disclaimer

You will need to grant Papi permission. It uses the tab URLs in order to sort the data, and then manages that list from local storage.

It fetches the tab data for the current window everytime you open Tab Papi.

## Keybinds

Note: For the full experience, go into the settings for Tab Papi and set a keybind to open it. I like `Ctrl+P`, but that might be `Print` for some of you.

**The keybinds only work with Tab Papi open, and will only work on your current window.**

## Detailed Usage

* Moving up & down highlights the row - this is the 'selected' group of tabs
* The actions only apply to the selected tabs
* Hitting `Tab` will toggle btwn the Current / Info tabs

Will be adding additional features. Enjoy.
